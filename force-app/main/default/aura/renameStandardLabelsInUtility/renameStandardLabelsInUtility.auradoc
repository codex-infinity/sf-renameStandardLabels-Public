        Background Utility Item responsible for dynamically translating and/or renaming
        Utility Bar item labels according to the logged-in user's language preference.

        This component acts as a workaround for a known Salesforce limitation where
        standard Utility Bar item labels (such as "History", "Recent Items", etc.)
        are always displayed in English, regardless of the user's locale.

        Translations are loaded from a JSON Static Resource and applied using
        lightning:utilityBarAPI.

    <aura:description>
        How it works:
        - The component listens to the aura:locationChange event, which is used as an
          alternative to onInit (not supported for Background Utility Items).
        - When triggered, the component:
            1. Retrieves all Utility Bar items using lightning:utilityBarAPI.
            2. Loads the "labelsAndTranslates" Static Resource (JSON format).
            3. Detects the user's current locale using $Locale.langLocale.
            4. Applies the corresponding translations to Utility Bar item labels
               and panel header labels.
            5. Marks the process as completed by setting hasRenamed to true.

        Prerequisites:
        - A Static Resource named "labelsAndTranslates" containing a JSON structure
          with translations mapped by locale (e.g. en_US, fr, pt_BR).
        - The component must be added to the Utility Bar as a Background Utility Item.

        Limitations and Notes:
        - Only Utility Bar item labels present in the translation JSON
          will be modified.
        - Labels not defined in the JSON will remain unchanged.
        - This solution is a workaround until Salesforce provides native support
          for Utility Bar item translations.
        - An invalid or malformed JSON resource may prevent label updates.
